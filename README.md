# react-app-from-scratch
## Learning more about how React works

I completed the official [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), but feel like too much was done for me to completely understand how everything works together. 
~~I will follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@JedaiSaboteur/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658)~~
The above tutorial is out of date, instead I will initialize the project with webpack and then add React to it.


### Objectives
---
- gain more familiarity with Webpack
- learn how to integrate React to a Webpack project
- learn how to create a React project without using `create-react-app` command
- create a React app that displays on my github pages 
- make better use of all the features git has to offer
- use Bable for the first time
